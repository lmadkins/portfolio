# Project 1: Portfolio

![Image of the front page of the site,white backdrop and all-caps black text, centered on the page. The heading reads'Louise Adkins' and below that are button links to a bio and a projects page, with icons as links to their GitHub, LinkedIn, and email. It is side-by-side with an image of the same site, but with the screen sized to a mobile phone. ](/img/entry-page-desktop-mobile.png)

### User Stories
- I want to see examples of projects (&/or the site itself) to demonstrate their skills, creativity, and enthusiasm.
- I want to see preview image(s) of the projects, have links to visit the projects, and to be able to access the code.
- I want to see links to get more information about this person and/or connect with them on other sites (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub)
- I want to the site to look good and be fully functional whether I'm on a desktop or laptop, tablet, or cellphone.
- I want the site to be easy to navigate, have good contrast and easy-to-read fonts, and other rudimentary accessibility features.

## Challenges/Tasks Still To-Be-Completed:
- Javascript could be DRYer (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Did not get around to solving functionality (yet) to close modals from clicking outside of them! For now they all rely on the 'close' button
- More complete and original projects, with more preview images and details
