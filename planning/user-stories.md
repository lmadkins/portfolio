As a visitor to a porfolio site, I want to see examples of projects (&/or the site itself) to demonstrate their skills, creativity, and enthusiasm.

I want to see preview image(s) of the projects, and ideally live links to visit the projects, and I want to be able to access the code.

I want to know this person's name and their background, and previous professional experience.

I want to see links to get more information about this person and/or connect with them on other sites (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub)

I want to the site to look good and be fully funcitonal whether I'm on a desktop or laptop, tablet, or cellphone.

I want the site to be easy to navigate, have good contrast and easy-to-read fonts

I want the site to have a strong whiff of the person's personality.
